# A Brief History of Fluent Bit

In 2014, the [Fluentd](https://fluentd.org) team at [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com) forecasted the need for a lightweight log processor for use in constrained environments like Embedded Linux and Gateways, the project aimed to be part of the Fluentd Ecosystem and we called it [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io), fully open source and available under the terms of the [Apache License v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

After the project was around for some time, it gained traction in the Embedded market but we also started getting requests for several features from the Cloud community like more inputs, filters and outputs. Not so long after that, Fluent Bit became one of the preferred solutions for solving the logging challenges associated with Cloud environments.
